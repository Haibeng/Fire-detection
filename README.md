# Fire-detection
This blog presents a construction-site fire detection algorithm built on an improved YOLOv8. We optimize the model from three perspectives—network architecture, lightweight convolutional reconstruction with inverted residual attention, and loss function—thereby substantially enhancing detection accuracy.
